# üö¶ Smart Traffic Flow Prediction Using BiLSTM
*A Machine Learning Framework for Sustainable Traffic Management in Accra, Ghana*

---

## üß† Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of the **MTech Thesis Project** titled:  
**‚ÄúMachine Learning Traffic Flow Prediction Models for Smart and Sustainable Traffic Management‚Äù**  
submitted to the **Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics**,  
**Accra Technical University**  
by **Evans Ataaya**, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the  
**Master of Technology (MTech) in Data Science and Industrial Analytics.**

## üéØ Objectives

The purpose of this work is to:
- Develop a **machine learning and deep learning framework** for short-term traffic flow prediction.  
- Compare the performance of Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, and BiLSTM models.  
- Deploy an interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** for real-time traffic forecasting and visualization.

## üß© Architecture

The dashboard uses:
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (for interactive visualization)
- **Backend:** Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
- **Model:** Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)
- **Dataset:** Accra Metropolitan Traffic Sensor Dataset (2025)
